        <h4>The Great Divide</h4>
        <p>
            In the world of web programming, there was once conflict, The burden of grouping text was left to the <span>monkeys</span> whose skills in such areas were so lacking that they could do little more than press the <b><i>Enter</i></b> key over dn over again
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there came the <span>DIV</span> and the <span>SPAN</span>. Lo these mighty tags brought peace to the realm and the <span>monkeys</span> lived happily ever after.
